# MIDAS-Agents

This is the agent and learning code for MIDAS, running in NodeJS and talking to the MIDAS ESB Service agent over HTTP (connection is managed by the esb proxy agent). We're using an Express server for serving some UIs.

Note that this relies on eve-nodejs, which is currently linked in with npm-link and maintained on a separate repo.

Installation instructions will follow.
